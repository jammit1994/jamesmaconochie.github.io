Welcome! I build and write about modular, biologically inspired approaches to AIâ€”how systems learn, adapt, and coordinate, and how human attention and meaning should guide what we build. These working papers are living documents: clear enough for practitioners, grounded enough for researchers, and open to revision as the field evolves.
