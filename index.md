excerpt: "Working papers and frameworks exploring intelligence, consciousness, and the architecture of reality - from evolutionary computation to the nature of human perception."

These working papers bridge evolutionary biology, cognitive science, and philosophy to understand both artificial and biological intelligence, and what they reveal about consciousness, truth, and human flourishing.
