## Dedication

This work is dedicated, first and foremost, to Jen, EZMac and HAM, but also to all of my family and good friends with whom I have shared some of these ideas. Thank you sincerely for your patience, support, and understanding in this matter, which is my passion.

## Context & Privilege

First of all, I am aware of how fortunate and privileged I am. I have never really struggled in my life in comparison to the majority of people. I had a great childhood, I received a first-class education, and I channeled these into a successful professional career. 

I am happily married (24 years), and my wife (Jen) and we have two sons (Ethan and Henry) in college. We live in a very comfortable home, and I don't believe we will ever face real economic uncertainty. I offer this first for critical context for what I share next.

## The Turning Point

The past two years have been the most challenging of my life. After 25 years in consulting, I was impacted by a reduction-in-force at my employer in September 2023. 

For the first 12 months, I went through a roller coaster of emotions between radical exuberance and despair. At my best, I saw it as a gift, an opportunity to step back and think about what I wanted to do for the remaining 15 years of my professional career. At my worst (with two college tuitions to pay on top of living expenses and a long-held expectation of achieving as much if not more than my parents), I just accepted that I needed to suck it up and find another account management position in consulting/digital transformation.

## The Interview Realization

In pursuit of the latter, I had multiple interviews with about a dozen well-established companies. I convinced myself I was enthusiastic about them, but despite this and what I believed was a solid and consistent interview performance, none of them resulted in an offer. This experience led me to two realizations:

1. **I hadn't really enjoyed the final 1 to 2 years in the consulting business** (it was, and still is, a tough time for consulting; economic uncertainty forced many traditional and reliable customers to cut costs internally and drastically reduce external spending).

2. **I recognized that I needed to work harder than I felt was normal to generate enthusiasm** for the opportunities I was interviewing for.

## The Shift

This resulted in my pulling back from the job search and thinking more about the things that genuinely interested and excited me. I decided to focus more on myself, my family, and do more of the things that I enjoyed (walking, reading/listening, cooking, getting together with great friends). 

A funny thing happened: after having had massive anxiety about the Thanksgiving and Christmas/New Year holidays for as long as I could remember, I had the best ones ever. I was present, relaxed, and genuinely wanted everyone to have a great time; none of the 'oh my god, when will this be over so we can get back to work and normal' thoughts were on my mind. Additionally, it provided me with the opportunity to travel back to the UK several times to spend time with my Mum.

## Discovering the Intellectual Path

After the holidays, in early 2024, I formalized an interest (that had been simmering for several years) in human decision-making (now questioning some of my past choices), artificial intelligence (everybody's (still) talking about it), and what each could do to inform/improve the other. 

I adjusted my listening habits (I listen to books and podcasts every day while walking for 1 to 2 hours) and sought to build a foundational understanding of the development of AI and the underpinnings of human decision-making and behavior. I loved it; it fed my hyper-curious and knowledge-thirsty nature and helped me crystallize an idea about a framework that might enable me (and maybe others) to make choices that result in greater health, happiness, and fulfillment—enter the Mastery of Life (MOL).

## The "Hippy Dippy" Phase

I know, I know, I had clearly flipped my lid and had gone all hippy dippy earthy feely. When I initially shared my idea with family and friends, they had a hard time understanding how this successful (albeit currently unemployed) technology professional was now talking Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.

I stuck to my guns and, in parallel with my continuing education listening, I decided it was time to get hands-on with AI and try using it to help me build a web application (a stepping stone to a mobile app) that embodied my emerging MOL framework. I won't be telling anyone who has tried something similar that this is an enlightening and humbling experience.

## Technical Rabbit Hole

I made rapid progress, but my initial focus was on an application tailored just for me. However, as my conviction in the idea strengthened, I decided it was time to expand the scope to a secure, multi-user, and customizable (to a certain extent) application. It is not at all lost on me that, after 25 years of guiding and advising organizations to be disciplined in their technology initiatives and guard against scope creep, I just blew up my baby. I went down the vibe coding rabbit hole.

Needless to say, my progress slowed drastically. As I focused on implementing registration, user profiles, and the related supporting infrastructure, the near-complete user interface got substantially degraded. After several weeks of only modestly productive churn, I stepped away. I decided to shift the majority of my attention to documenting some of the core ideas that were emerging from my listening, reading, and vibe coding experience.

## From Code to Concepts

In March 2025, I began creating (what is now a series of) LinkedIn articles and posts related to AI, AGI, human intelligence, and the relationship between the two:

## From Articles to Framework

LinkedIn posts and articles are intentionally limited in their detail, given the medium. The ideas and concepts I shared in summary form on LinkedIn up until early October were a fraction of the thinking I have done and the supporting evidence I have gathered. Furthermore, my work includes several related ideas that I had yet to share, so I decided it was time to put all of the ideas into a series of four (for now) working papers that you can find on this website.

## The Journey Continues

The journey continues, and I will continue to expand this body of work. Making it publicly available will generate comments, feedback, and opportunities for collaboration with other organizations and/or individuals who find these ideas resonant.

## Acknowledgements

I am indebted to the authors, researchers, and thinkers—past, present, and future—whose work has inspired and informed my thinking. The books featured on this site represent just a fraction of the intellectual traditions that have shaped this framework.

*This journey remains ongoing, and I welcome conversations with fellow travelers.*
