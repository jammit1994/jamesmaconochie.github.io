## Dedication

This work is dedicated, first and foremost, to Jen, Ethan and Henry, but also to all of my family and good friends with whom I have shared some of these ideas. Thank you sincerely for your patience, support, and understanding in this matter, which is my passion.


## Where It Began

Work in progress - come back soon.

## The Journey Continues

While I've moved beyond traditional consulting for the time being; the skills honed over 25 years—translating complex business needs into technical architecture, guiding organizations through digital transformation, and bridging strategic vision with practical implementation remain incredibly valuable. I'm particularly interested in applying these skills to organizations working on AI safety, human-AI collaboration, or biologically-inspired computing.

The consulting world taught me how to solve complex problems at scale; now I'm applying those lessons to what may be humanity's most important challenge: ensuring artificial intelligence develops in ways that enhance rather than replace human capability and wisdom.

## Acknowledgements

I am indebted to the authors, researchers, and thinkers—past, present, and future—whose work has inspired and informed my thinking. The books featured on this site represent just a fraction of the intellectual traditions that have shaped this framework.

*This journey remains ongoing, and I welcome conversations with fellow travelers.*
