I'm a technology leader with 25 years of experience implementing complex systems across enterprise organizations. After spending decades in consulting helping companies navigate digital transformation, I'm now focused on a question that matters: how do we build artificial intelligence that augments human capability rather than replaces it?

My work explores the architectural principles that enable effective human-AI collaboration. Drawing on insights from evolutionary neuroscience, cognitive science, and real-world implementation experience, I advocate for AI systems that are modular, interpretable, and designed to complement human judgment.

## Background

- **BS Civil Engineering**, Imperial College London (1993)
- **MS Civil Engineering**, MIT (1994)
- **25+ years** leading technology programs and transformations
- Based in Boston, Massachusetts

## Current Focus

I'm exploring how principles from biological intelligence—modularity, plasticity, causal reasoning, and efficient attention allocation—can inform the development of artificial intelligence systems. Rather than pursuing artificial general intelligence through pure computational scaling, I'm interested in architectures that enhance human decision-making and preserve human agency.

My research integrates frameworks across multiple domains:
- **Evolutionary computation** and the constraints that shaped biological intelligence
- **Human-AI symbiosis** and Augmented Human Intelligence (AHI)
- **Attention theory** as a unifying principle across biological and artificial systems
- **Practical frameworks** for deliberate living in an age of information abundance

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking opportunities to contribute to AI research and development—whether in academic labs, research institutions, or forward-thinking startups—where strategic thinking, systems architecture, and implementation experience can help shape how we build AI that serves humanity.

If you're working on human-AI collaboration, AI safety and alignment, or modular AI architectures, I'd welcome a conversation.
